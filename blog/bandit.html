                <span style="font-style:italic;">Disclaimer: This review will <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> contain any 
                solutions for Bandit or any other wargames. </span><br /><br />
                
                I have a confession. Linux has been on my resume for quite a long while. In a way, it made sense. I knew how to ls and cd, I could clone a git repo,
                and I even installed Ubuntu on one of my home PC's without following a tutorial on YouTube! In reality, though, it's hard to know
                what you don't know. I said I was proficient in Linux, but I was really proficient in stumbling around the Ubuntu GUI. As for the terminal, 
                I could maybe use it to read some files. That was about it.<br /><br />

                That is, until I tried <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/">Bandit</a>. Bandit is a capture-the-flag wargame made for absolute 
                beginners. Users must work to use the information they currently have access to in order to find the hidden way to log into the next level.
                The first challenge for me, was learning how to SSH into the server. Like I said, I really overestimated my Linux skills. But after learning to 
                access the user, <code style="color:white;">Bandit0</code>, a beginner like me will feel more accomplished with every successful level.<br /><br />

                Bandit's greatest strength is also one of its greatest weaknesses: its length. With over 30 levels, most other wargames look puny compared to it, 
                allowing Bandit to touch on a wide variety of Linux concepts. Early passwords are stored in plaintext files with the only challenge being 
                how to access their contents. The game quickly ramps up to include [Minor spoiler] <span class="spoiler">SSH keys, cron jobs, git, and more.</span>
                After awhile, though, some of the levels do begin to feel a little repetitive.<br /><br />

                By the end of the game, you will be able to do just about anything you need to in order to access and do work on a remote Linux server. After the 
                many hours spent on the game, I have gotten to the point where I feel more comfortable in the terminal than on the Ubuntu GUI and I'm looking for 
                projects I can undertake to dive even deeper into Linux. If you have never used Linux before or find yourself going to Google to remember, "Which one 
                is echo again?" Bandit will give you the skills you need to say that, yes, you do know how to use Linux. <br /><br />

                If you decide to have a crack at it, I've left a link below. Good luck!<br /><br />
