                Hello! In case you found yourself here before any of the other pages, allow me to introduce myself. I am currently a computer science student at Temple University,
                and this is a blog to jot down thoughts, struggles, and successes as I learn more about computers, networks, software development, and anything
                else I may decide to try my hand at (or get assigned in a class.) <br /> <br />
                I've decided to start this blog primarily for two reasons. The first is that I'm already paying for the domain name and I've always believed in getting
                one's money's worth out of every purchase. The second reason, which is also what I hope it provides for you, is to document my growth from nascent
                programmer and student to a professional. The first few blog posts I have planned are reviews of capture-the-flag wargames for beginners and write-ups on my 
                experience with programming tutorials and projects.<br /> <br />
                One day, I hope to be doing write-ups on the nuances of my eventual specialty and writing tutorials of my own. When that day comes, I'm sure I 
                will love to look back on how much my technical knowledge and problem solving ability evolved. I also hope that I can one day point to these early posts
                as resources for beginners who may feel that learning everything they want to eventually know is impossible. I want this real-time documentation of someone
                taking that journey themselves, who has felt that overwhelming feeling, to motivate other learners. <br /><br />
