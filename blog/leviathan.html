                <span style="font-style:italic;">Disclaimer: This review will <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> contain any solutions for 
                Leviathan or any other wargames. </span><br /><br />

                When first starting to study any subject, the first thing you have to learn is, well, what you have to learn. Until I dug into cooking 
                books and recipes, I had no idea just how many ways there are to cut an onion. When I first heard I needed to learn Linux, I felt
                about the same. <span style="font-style:italic;">How hard can it be,</span> I thought. After all, I knew how to log in and use the terminal.
                I could even SSH in with a private key and take advantage of flaws in user permissions, thanks to <a href="./bandit.html">Bandit</a>, 
                another wargame testing Linux knowledge. <br /><br />
                
                The answer was: harder than I thought. For someone who has only used Linux for a matter of months, logging into OverTheWire's <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/">
                Leviathan</a>, a capture-the-flag wargame meant to teach users about common vulnerabilities, did feel a bit like being tossed into the deep 
                end of the pool. The main page of the game has information for logging into the first level, where to find the password for the level you are 
                already on, and that's it. Every other page for the game's website has the same message: "There is no information for this level, 
                intentionally."<br /><br />

                Logging into the server the first time was the most I've really felt like I got into a system that I wasn't quite meant to be in. There were no hints,
                no README, and no clues beyond what I could discover from poking around. So, I got to poking around. The seven levels that followed leaped from 
                one level of difficulty to another. Linux commands escalated from [Minor spoiler] <span class="spoiler">cat and grep to analyzing library calls and writing
                bash scripts.</span> <br /><br />

                While this wargame isn't meant for complete beginners to Linux, no one who makes through all seven challenges will be a beginner by the end
                of it. If you've used Linux before, maybe even done some other beginner capture-the-flag's, and you're wondering what it would take to feel that you really
                understand the terminal, Leviathan is for you.<br /><br />

                If you decide to have a crack at it, I've left a link below. Good luck!<br /><br />
